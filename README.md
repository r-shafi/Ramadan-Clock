# Ramadan Clock

A simple clock app built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that shows **Iftar and Sehri timings** for the current day in **Sylhet**.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Some of the APIs used in this app may no longer work, since this project was created when I first started learning to code (around 2021).
